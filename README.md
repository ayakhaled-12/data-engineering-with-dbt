# data-engineering-with-dbt


This repository is designed for practicing the concepts outlined in the "Data Engineering with dbt" book. 
The book introduces readers to dbt and its role in the data stack, as well as how it uses simple SQL to build a data platform. 
The goal of the book is to help readers work better together with their teams by leveraging data modeling, data quality, master data management, and more to build a simple-to-understand and future-proof solution.


# The initial data model and glossary
- This sample project is about being able to track the value of investments spread across multiple portfolios and analyze them in the ways we prefer. 
- The starting use case is that an investor has portfolios, potentially at different brokers, where they hold positions in securities. They can buy and sell securities, therefore opening, closing, and changing the positions they have.
